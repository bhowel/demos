### About TuffDataList
TuffDataList is a plugin whose time has passed. It's not really useful for responsive or mobile web sites.
It's not hosted on Github and there's no command line installation.
You can't easily integrate it into a framework like Ember or Angular.
There's only one container for all the lists in a page, and it's missing lots of options.

However, it does require some explanation to install and use it! And that's why I picked it for the subject
of this user guide example.

I'm not providing TuffDataList to anyone, so the links for downloading the plugin and the seed application
aren't live.
