You can use any data source - REST services, JSON files, Javascript objects - 
to populate lists in TuffDataList, as long as you convert or extract the final result
into a format TuffDataList can read.

In this section, we'll show you how to set up your data for TuffDataList.
If you're using a static data source, you can follow our format to create your data.

If you're using a supplied data source or data from a web service, you'll have to
convert the data into a matching format. Use <a href="#Converting-your-data">Converting your data</a>
