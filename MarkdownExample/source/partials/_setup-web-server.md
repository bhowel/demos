### Set up a web server

TuffDataList uses iframes. Some browsers don't display the contents of iframes unless your web application
is running on a server.
We recommend running your application on a server, even if you're creating a completely static site.

If you're new to web development or don't know anything about web servers, don't worry!
There's plenty of free, open source packages available, such as
<a href="http://sailsjs.org/get-started" target="_blank">sails</a>.
Most of the packages are very easy to set up.

Before you install an open source server, you should probably install
<a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">node.js</a>, which includes
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" target="_blank">npm</a>, the package manager for node.js.
Many open source packages use npm for installation. If you already have node.js, you should

before you start.
